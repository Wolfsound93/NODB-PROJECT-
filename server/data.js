    What it do, young niggas? What it do, young bitches?
    I got my drink in my cup, I got my Backwood, no Swishers
    And bitch, I'm faded, fucking faded, yeah, I'm famous
    What? I'm famous, fucking famous, nigga I made it!
    When I was broke, I got me that nine
    With that nine, I hit me that lick
    And then with that lick, it came with that yola
    With that yola, it came with your bitch
    And see now your bitch, she gon' work on that corner
    I don't care if that ho got pneumonia
    Give me racks and you won't get a quota
    She don't run game, I'm the only controller
    So what's up now? Straight pimpin' over here
    And I put that shit on Vers, nigga
    I been checking ass all on the curb, nigga
    You could tell that she fucking with a Figg nigga
    What it is, nigga? Perrier Jouet Rosé, I might relocate
    Out of my mind, this world, I'm high, goddammit, I'm fly
    (Yay-yay) My grandma showed me my first strap
    My nigga Rat-Tone always had the flyest gats
    I finally got mine... dirt nap

    Bitch nigga, what you call that?
    We on block patrol, nigga fuck your roll, got the gat on me
    Nigga look, it's right here, bulldog bark, you could die right here
    Real gangsta niggas don't have no fear
    Real niggas never tattoo their tears
    Hopping out of vans, disturbing your plans
    All hoodied up, no Wu-Tang Clan
    Three Js letting off through that Aryan, call that bitch 3 for 10
    I'm fucking up the streets again
    Tags on the toes all amongst your friends
    Let the barrel spin, get blended in, embrace the funk
    Groovy as I'm running through your system
    Seem like you only target Hindu victims
    Red dot, chicken pox type symptoms
    Sad day, had his whole family sickened
    Trying to state the facts
    We don't care if he elect you black, we got a strap
    Gangsta shit, she with me if I'm broke or rich, I got a bitch
    Ain't sober, kush odor, kush sodas, crip stoner
    Real soldier, head off shoulders, makeover

    Dip in my hand then I palm trees
    So when you throw shade, it could never harm me
    (So when you throw shade, it could never harm me)
    So much grams, unzip the bag
    Dip in my hand then I palm trees
    So when you throw shade, it could never harm me
    (So when you throw shade, it could never harm me)
    Lions don't lose sleep over the opinion of sheep
    On the road to the riches, money sticking to my cleats
    I am moi, magnifique, skin noir, Darky Meech
    Niggas with the most opinions, usually have the least
    It's funny how now rappers be on the druggy shit
    Downloaded my tape, sat back, studied shit
    Acid pack a hundred hits, shrooms, caps and hash bricks
    Trippy like that Destiny Child chick, on 106
    This white bitch, had the fucking nerves to call me a nigga
    When she the one paying the surgeon for her lips to get bigger
    Do you get the bigger picture, shit is backwards my nigga
    You sneak dissing, taking jabs, get your boxing on
    Cause you ain't get the word, I'm Glock Lesnar in the octagon
    This shit is straight absurd, do not hate me cause your life is shitty
    I show no pity you turd, you better off in the dirt, naw
    Now you better off dead, like the title of my work...
    So much grams, unzip the bag
    Dip in my hand then I palm trees
    So when you throw shade, it could never harm me
    (So when you throw shade, it could never harm me)
    Everyday, me and Mary Jane
    You might say I'm addicted but me, I'm truly lifted
    Stoned so loud, you can hear me in the crowd
    Smoking girl scout, sour by the ounce
    Mary never cheat me
    Mary not a backstabbing bitch that'll lie and deceive me
    Spread it even! Even! Hash wax in the evening
    Dab or die trying, on the road to Zion
    Damn, they try and stick me for my paper
    They tryna take me under, I've seen it through the vapors
    Jealous ones still envy, got a couple real with me
    And my bitch, will talk some shit and smoke the kill with me
    Meech will hide the body, enough of that tho'
    They saying talk is cheap, so I'll be smiling when we meet
    They screaming "Zombies!" out in England
    But I'm on the block with Mary, pushing and dreaming
    Ah ah ah, I'm feeling myself
    Thizzle, fo' shizzle my nizzle spitting riddles on instrumentals
    Trippy life, blotter in the night
    Fill my appetite (Fill my appetite)
    So much grams, unzip the bag
    Dip in my hand then I palm trees
    So when you throw shade, it could never harm me
    (So when you throw shade, it could never harm me)
    Could be your mans, or be your fan, or be your kin
    Pay your dues, man I gotta choose, whether I lose or win this
    Foe or friend, can't determine the difference
    The instance they see you peaking, they pussy be leaking fluid
    My nigga, what is you doing, all black in the back of a Buick
    I'm proving I'm sadistic and sinning as I'm making murderous music
    We don't rep the same things, nah, don't bother confuse it
    So much stressing on my brain, momma think I'mma lose it
    Human vagabond, hoes that stow they panties in my carry on
    Why you hating niggas acting nonchalant (Honest bruh)
    Fuck your publication that say I'm a third wheel
    Architect blow your mind, set stress but won't swell
    Oh yes, I smoke kill, I'm crack, you smoke krills
    I pack, you dope deal, in fact, I'm so chill
    I'm never off the pivot, six stitches to your image
    Not offended, when you call me genius, all that means is...
    So much grams, unzip the bag
    Dip in my hand then I palm trees
    So when you throw shade, it could never harm me

    I went from Smart Car to a bitch with some smart lips

    I'm goin' fishin' with these little bitty shrimp dips
    And my bank roll got a big dip
    She gon' bring it on a big ship
    Quite trill, no Quik Trip
    I got drugs in the alley, no tip there

    Smoke way more weed than a guy in L.A
    I want them birds 'til next May
    Never let em fly away
    What!? I heard ay

    If it ain't about the money
    Don't be blowin' me up, nigga I ain't gettin' up

    You playin' with it, I'ma send 'em through your car door
    But while I flood the shit sick got prob' oh
    I'm doin' it for black and yellow, free Hardo
    The head honcho, nigga no Tonto, nigga
